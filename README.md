Abstract: Using data from Ecuador’s 2015 Innovation Survey, this article
examines whether engaging in innovation activities influences firms’ export
propensity and intensity, in a developing country like Ecuador. Additionally, it
explores whether the introduction of innovative technologies influences firms’
export behaviour. Given the observational nature of the data, this paper uses the
inverse probability weighting (IPW) method to generate a counterfactual that
can be compared to firms that engage in innovative activities and have
introduced innovative technologies. The results suggest that engaging in
innovation activities has no effect on firms’ export behaviour. However, the
introduction of innovative technologies increases a firm’s propensity to export,
though it does not account for firm differences in export intensity.
